# Machine Learning - Neural Networks Learning

#### <em>Implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.<br>

<strong>Files that I had to write code to:</strong><br>
<em>sigmoidGradient.m</em></strong> - Compute the gradient of the sigmoid function<br>
<em>randInitializeWeights.m</em></strong> - Randomly initialize weights<br>
<em>nnCostFunction.m</em></strong> - Neural network cost function<br>
